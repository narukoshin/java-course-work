This is a JavaFX-based web crawler that uses a powerful Google's advanced search parameters to find websites with readable .git folders. Once the crawler locates a website with a .git folder, it is able to download the contents of the folder and extract the source code of the website with additional tools.

The crawler is simple to use and includes a minimalistic GUI that allows users to easily change its settings. Additionally, the crawler is integrated with SQLite3, which enables it to store the data it collects.

The options button provides the ability to further customize search parameters, such as filtering by the last time a website was updated. Additionally, if the crawler encounters a captcha page, users can avoid it by changing the cookie value.

Overall, this Git Crawler is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of finding and extracting source code from websites with .git folders. This tool is good for penetration testers and bug hunters.
